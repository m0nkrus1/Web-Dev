        <h1>Digital Dreams</h1>
        
        <p>
            In the quiet glow of a monitor's light,<br>
            Where code and creativity take flight,<br>
            Zeroes and ones in patterns dance,<br>
            Giving the future a second chance.<br>
            <br>
            The web connects across the miles,<br>
            Turning frowns into happy smiles,<br>
            A poem born in digital streams,<br>
            Fulfilling our programming dreams.
